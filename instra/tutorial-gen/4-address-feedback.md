# address feedback

Review the instructions for creating a tutorial, and the test results from previous steps. Address issues that arose during testing, as long as they are valid and don't contradict your instructions.
## formatting and style

If the previous step identified any formatting issues, fix them:

**Backticks corrections:**
- Replace double quotes around technical terms with backticks
- Remove redundant quotes around backticked content
- Ensure all commands, file paths, resource IDs, and status values use backticks

**Tilde corrections:**
- Replace tildes meaning "approximately" with the word "approximately"
- Ensure tildes are only used in code blocks for home directory paths

**Quote corrections:**
- Remove unnecessary double quotes around technical terms in descriptive text
- Maintain quotes only for actual quoted content or JSON strings in code blocks
## deprecated features

If the previous step identified any deprecated features, revise the scripts and tutorial to use recommended features that provide the same functionality. If there isn't a newer feature available that provides the same functionality, remove the steps that use the deprecated feature. If the tutorial can't be completed without these steps, generate an error report and ask the user what to do next.

## pricing

Note the costs associated with running the resources in the tutorial in the prerequisites section.

## production readiness

If the previous step identified any issues with security or architecture best practices, note these issues in a section named "Going to production". Note that the purpose of the tutorial is to educate the reader ("you") on how the service API works, not how to build a production application, and that there are numerous resources on solutions architecture and security architecture that are beyond the scope of this content. link to some.

## readme

Generate a readme file that provides a high level overview of the tutorial and a list of the resources within.

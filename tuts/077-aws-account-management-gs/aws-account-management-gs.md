## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

1. The AWS CLI. If you need to install it, follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). You can also use AWS CloudShell, which includes the AWS CLI.

2. Configured your AWS CLI with appropriate credentials. Run `aws configure` if you haven't set up your credentials yet.

3. [Sufficient permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/security_iam_service-with-iam.html) to perform account management operations. Different operations require different permissions, which are noted in each section.

**Time to complete:** Approximately 30 minutes

**Cost:** There are no direct costs associated with the operations in this tutorial. Account management operations are free to use.

Let's get started with managing your AWS account using the CLI.

## View account identifiers

AWS assigns unique identifiers to each account that are useful for various operations and cross-account access. In this section, you'll learn how to retrieve these identifiers.

**Required permissions:**
- `sts:GetCallerIdentity` (for account ID and ARN)
- `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` (for canonical user ID)

**Find your AWS account ID**

The following command retrieves your 12-digit AWS account ID:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

Example output:
```
123456789012
```

This account ID uniquely identifies your AWS account and is used in many AWS operations, including resource ARNs and cross-account access.

**View detailed caller identity information**

To see more detailed information about your identity, including the IAM user or role you're using:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Example output:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDAXMPL123456789",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example-user"
}
```

This information helps you confirm which account and IAM entity you're using for AWS CLI operations.

**Find your canonical user ID**

The canonical user ID is used primarily for Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs):

```bash
aws s3api list-buckets --query Owner.ID --output text
```

Example output:
```
79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be
```

The canonical user ID is an obfuscated form of your AWS account ID used specifically for S3 bucket policies and ACLs.

**Tip:** Store your account ID in an environment variable for easy reference in scripts:
```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
echo "My account ID is $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID"
```

## View account information

You can retrieve various details about your AWS account using the AWS CLI. This information includes contact details and other account settings.

**Required permissions:**
- `account:GetContactInformation`

**Get account contact information**

The following command retrieves the primary contact information for your account:

```bash
aws account get-contact-information
```

Example output:
```json
{
    "ContactInformation": {
        "AddressLine1": "123 Example Street",
        "City": "Seattle",
        "CountryCode": "US",
        "FullName": "Example Company",
        "PhoneNumber": "+1-555-555-0100",
        "PostalCode": "98101",
        "StateOrRegion": "WA"
    }
}
```

This information represents the primary contact details associated with your AWS account. To update this information, you would use the `put-contact-information` command.

**Best practice:** Ensure your contact information is up-to-date so that AWS can reach you regarding important account notifications, security alerts, and billing information.

## Manage AWS regions

AWS allows you to control which regions are enabled for your account. This section shows you how to list regions and manage their status.

**Required permissions:**
- `account:ListRegions`
- `account:GetRegionOptStatus`
- `account:EnableRegion`
- `account:DisableRegion`

**List available regions**

To see all available AWS regions and their current status:

```bash
aws account list-regions
```

Example output (truncated):
```json
{
    "Regions": [
        {
            "RegionName": "us-east-1",
            "RegionOptStatus": "ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT"
        },
        {
            "RegionName": "af-south-1",
            "RegionOptStatus": "DISABLED"
        }
    ]
}
```

The output shows all AWS regions and whether they are enabled, disabled, or enabled by default for your account.

**Display regions in a more readable format**

For a cleaner, more readable display of regions and their status, you can use this command:

```bash
aws account list-regions --query 'Regions[*].[RegionName,RegionOptStatus]' --output text | while read -r region status; do
    printf "%-15s | %s\n" "$region" "$status"
done
```

Example output:
```
us-east-1       | ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT
us-east-2       | ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT
us-west-1       | ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT
us-west-2       | ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT
af-south-1      | DISABLED
ap-east-1       | DISABLED
```

This format makes it easier to scan through the list and quickly identify which regions are enabled or disabled.

**Check the status of a specific region**

To check the status of a particular region:

```bash
aws account get-region-opt-status --region-name af-south-1
```

Example output:
```json
{
    "RegionName": "af-south-1",
    "RegionOptStatus": "DISABLED"
}
```

This shows whether the specified region is currently enabled or disabled for your account.

**Enable a region**

If you have the necessary permissions, you can enable a region with:

```bash
aws account enable-region --region-name af-south-1
```

This command doesn't produce output if successful. The operation is asynchronous, so you should check the status afterward:

```bash
aws account get-region-opt-status --region-name af-south-1
```

**Disable a region**

Similarly, you can disable a region if it's not needed:

```bash
aws account disable-region --region-name af-south-1
```

**Important:** Disabling a region that contains resources will make those resources inaccessible via IAM, though you'll still be charged for them. Always ensure you've migrated or deleted all resources in a region before disabling it.

## Manage alternate contacts

AWS allows you to specify alternate contacts for billing, operations, and security purposes. These contacts receive important communications from AWS.

**Required permissions:**
- `account:GetAlternateContact`
- `account:PutAlternateContact`
- `account:DeleteAlternateContact`

**View alternate contacts**

To view your current billing alternate contact:

```bash
aws account get-alternate-contact --alternate-contact-type BILLING
```

Example output:
```json
{
    "AlternateContact": {
        "AlternateContactType": "BILLING",
        "EmailAddress": "billing@example.com",
        "Name": "Billing Team",
        "PhoneNumber": "+1-555-555-1234",
        "Title": "Finance Manager"
    }
}
```

You can also view operations and security contacts by changing the `--alternate-contact-type` parameter to `OPERATIONS` or `SECURITY`.

**Add or update an alternate contact**

To add or update an alternate contact:

```bash
aws account put-alternate-contact \
    --alternate-contact-type OPERATIONS \
    --email-address operations@example.com \
    --name "Operations Team" \
    --phone-number "+1-555-555-5678" \
    --title "Operations Manager"
```

This command doesn't produce output if successful. If you perform this operation on a contact type that already exists, it will update the existing contact.

**Delete an alternate contact**

To remove an alternate contact:

```bash
aws account delete-alternate-contact --alternate-contact-type SECURITY
```

This command doesn't produce output if successful.

**Best practice:** Use distribution lists rather than individual email addresses for alternate contacts to ensure notifications are received even when staff changes occur.

## Update account name

You can update your AWS account name to better reflect its purpose or organization.

**Required permissions:**
- `account:PutAccountName`

**Update account name for a standalone account**

```bash
aws account put-account-name --account-name "Production Account"
```

This command doesn't produce output if successful. The account name will be updated immediately, though it may take some time to reflect across all AWS services.

**Update account name for a member account in an organization**

If you have the necessary permissions in an AWS Organization:

```bash
aws account put-account-name --account-id 123456789012 --account-name "Production Account"
```

This allows organization administrators to maintain consistent naming conventions across all accounts.

**Best practice:** Use a consistent naming convention for your accounts, such as `<department>-<environment>-<purpose>` (e.g., "finance-prod-reporting").

## Manage root user email

For security and administrative purposes, you might need to update the root user email address. This can only be done through a multi-step process.

**Required permissions for organization administrators:**
- `account:GetPrimaryEmail`
- `account:StartPrimaryEmailUpdate`
- `account:AcceptPrimaryEmailUpdate`

**For member accounts in an organization**

Step 1: Start the email update process:

```bash
aws account start-primary-email-update --account-id 123456789012 --primary-email new-email@example.com
```

Step 2: After receiving the one-time password (OTP) at the new email address:

```bash
aws account accept-primary-email-update --account-id 123456789012 --otp 12345678 --primary-email new-email@example.com
```

This two-step verification process ensures that only authorized users can update the root email address.

**Note:** For standalone accounts, the root user email can only be updated through the AWS Management Console by signing in as the root user.

## Troubleshooting common issues

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter when using the AWS CLI for account management:

**Permission denied errors**

If you see an error like:
```
An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the GetAlternateContact operation: User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example-user is not authorized to perform: account:GetAlternateContact
```

Solution: Ensure your IAM user or role has the necessary permissions. Add the required permission to your IAM policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "account:GetAlternateContact",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Organization-related errors**

If you see an error like:
```
An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the EnableRegion operation: Account region opt status can only be modified through Isengard.
```

Solution: Ensure you're using an account with the appropriate permissions in the organization. For organization operations, you typically need to use the management account or a delegated administrator account.

**Rate limiting errors**

If you see an error like:
```
An error occurred (TooManyRequestsException) when calling the EnableRegion operation
```

Solution: Implement exponential backoff in your scripts or wait a few minutes before retrying the operation.

## Cleanup

Most operations in this tutorial are read-only and don't create resources that need cleanup. However, if you've made changes to your account configuration, consider the following:

**Regions you've enabled**

If you enabled regions for testing purposes and don't plan to use them, you should disable them to prevent accidental resource creation:

```bash
aws account disable-region --region-name af-south-1
```

**Alternate contacts you've added**

If you added test alternate contacts, you might want to remove them:

```bash
aws account delete-alternate-contact --alternate-contact-type OPERATIONS
```

**Account name changes**

If you changed your account name for testing, you might want to revert it:

```bash
aws account put-account-name --account-name "Original Account Name"
```

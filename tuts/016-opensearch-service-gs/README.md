# Amazon OpenSearch Service getting started

This tutorial demonstrates how to get started with Amazon OpenSearch Service by creating a search domain, indexing documents, and performing search and analytics operations on your data.

You can run the shell script to automatically set up the OpenSearch Service domain and sample data, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial to manually configure your search and analytics environment.

## Resources Created

The script creates the following AWS resources in order:

â€¢ OpenSearch domain

The script prompts you to clean up resources when you run it, including if there's an error part way through. If you need to clean up resources later, you can use the script log as a reference point for which resources were created.

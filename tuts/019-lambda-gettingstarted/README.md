# AWS Lambda getting started

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to AWS Lambda, covering how to create, deploy, and manage serverless functions that run your code without provisioning or managing servers.

You can either run the automated script `lambda-gettingstarted.sh` to execute all the steps automatically, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the `lambda-gettingstarted.md` tutorial to understand each operation in detail.

## Resources Created

The script creates the following AWS resources in order:

• IAM role
• IAM role policy
• Lambda function

The script prompts you to clean up resources when you run it, including if there's an error part way through. If you need to clean up resources later, you can use the script log as a reference point for which resources were created.

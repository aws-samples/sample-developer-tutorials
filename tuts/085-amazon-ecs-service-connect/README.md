# Amazon ECS Service Connect

This tutorial guides you through setting up Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Service Connect using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You'll learn how to create an ECS cluster with Service Connect enabled, deploy a containerized application, and configure service discovery for inter-service communication.

You can either run the automated shell script (`amazon-ecs-service-connect.sh`) to quickly set up the entire environment, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial (`amazon-ecs-service-connect.md`) to understand each component in detail. Both approaches will help you understand how to implement service-to-service communication in Amazon ECS using Service Connect.

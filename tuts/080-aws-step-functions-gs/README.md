# AWS Step Functions getting started

This tutorial guides you through creating and running your first AWS Step Functions state machine using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You'll learn how to create a simple workflow, execute it with different inputs, and integrate with Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis.

You can either run the automated shell script (`aws-step-functions-gs.sh`) to quickly set up the entire environment, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial (`aws-step-functions-gs.md`) to understand each component in detail. Both approaches will help you understand how to build serverless workflows using AWS Step Functions to coordinate multiple AWS services.

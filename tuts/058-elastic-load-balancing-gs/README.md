# Elastic Load Balancing getting started

This tutorial guides you through creating and configuring an Application Load Balancer using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You'll learn how to create a load balancer, configure target groups, register targets, and set up listeners to distribute traffic to your applications.

You can either run the automated shell script (`elastic-load-balancing-gs.sh`) to quickly set up the entire environment, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial (`elastic-load-balancing-gs.md`) to understand each component in detail. Both approaches will help you understand how to use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets for improved availability and fault tolerance.

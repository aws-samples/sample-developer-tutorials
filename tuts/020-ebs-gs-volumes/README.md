# Amazon EBS getting started volumes

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating and managing Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You'll learn how to create volumes, check their status, attach them to Amazon EC2 instances, and clean up resources when you're done.

You can either run the automated shell script (`ebs-gs-volumes.sh`) to quickly set up the entire environment, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial (`ebs-gs-volumes.md`) to understand each component in detail. Both approaches will help you understand how to work with Amazon EBS volumes for persistent storage with your Amazon EC2 instances.

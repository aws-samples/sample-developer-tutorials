# Amazon Q Business ICA

This tutorial guides you through creating an Amazon Q Business application with Identity Center Authentication (ICA) using the AWS CLI. Amazon Q Business is a generative AI-powered assistant that helps your employees find information and complete tasks within your organization. The tutorial covers setting up AWS IAM Identity Center, creating necessary IAM roles and policies, configuring user access, and optionally creating a web experience for browser-based access.

You can either run the automated shell script `qbusiness-ica.sh` to create all the resources at once, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the `qbusiness-ica.md` tutorial to understand each component in detail. The tutorial includes cleanup steps to avoid ongoing charges and best practices for production deployments.

# Amazon Polly getting started

This tutorial guides you through the process of using Amazon Polly with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. You'll learn how to explore available voices, synthesize speech from text, and save the audio output to files.

You can either run the automated shell script (`amazon-polly-getting-started.sh`) to execute all the examples at once, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial (`amazon-polly-getting-started.md`) to understand each command in detail. The shell script includes logging and error handling, making it easy to see what commands are being executed and their results.

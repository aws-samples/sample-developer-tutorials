# Amazon Simple Notification Service getting started

This tutorial demonstrates how to get started with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) by creating topics, subscribing to notifications, and sending messages to multiple endpoints.

You can run the shell script to automatically set up the Amazon SNS resources, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial to manually configure your notification infrastructure.

The script creates the following AWS resources in order:

â€¢ SNS topic

The script prompts you to clean up resources when you run it, including if there's an error part way through. If you need to clean up resources later, you can use the script log as a reference point for which resources were created.

# Amazon Elastic Container Service EC2 getting started

This tutorial demonstrates how to get started with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) using EC2 instances as the compute platform. You'll learn how to create an ECS cluster, define a task definition, and run containerized applications on EC2 instances within your ECS cluster.

You can either run the automated shell script (`ecs-ec2-getting-started.sh`) to quickly set up the entire environment, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial (`ecs-ec2-getting-started.md`) to understand each component and manually configure your ECS environment.
